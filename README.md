## Description

Welcome to the Social Network API backend application. This powerful system utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, in conjunction with Mongoose and Express.js to create a robust API for your social networking web application. With this API, users can seamlessly share their thoughts, interact with others' posts, and manage their friends list. Plus, we've integrated Moment.js to ensure elegant date formatting throughout the platform.

## Installation

Git clone the repository.

Once downloaded please make sure to download all necessary npm packages by opening integrated terminal and typing in:

`npm i`



## Usage

To run the backend application you must first make sure to create your own 'env' file to connect to your MongoDB database correctly. Afterwards you may run the server by running the command:

`node server.js`

From there, you may run all the routes. Please know that there is no seed data so you'll have to create your own data within Insomnia.
